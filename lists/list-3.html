                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            After the introductions of abstract algebra, then these 3 came about:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A group is a set with one operation that follows certain rules. It surprised me to learn that something as simple as adding numbers under modulo can form a group.
                            In real life, groups are used in cryptography (like RSA and Diffie-Hellman) and in understanding symmetry in everything from molecules in chemistry to animations in video games.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A ring introduces two operations, like addition and multiplication, but doesn't require everything to be invertible, kind of like how integers behave.
                            Rings are found in computer systems and coding theory, where operations are done over integers or modular systems, such as checksums and error detection in data transmission.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A field is even more structured, like the real numbers, where you can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero). Fields are essential in digital signal processing, graphics, and finance, where calculations require all arithmetic operations, including division.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started to find it really interesting. It was like discovering that algebra isn't just about solving equations, it's about understanding the structure behind the math itself.
                        </p>

                                            Simplest one and my favorite of all the 3 topics, was very easy to understand.

                                            Way more confusing than groups, but I understood it after a few rewatches on yt, though I don't particularly like the lesson, it was mid.

                                            Surprisingly, this was easier to understand than rings since I think we're familiar with this, this is what we usually deal with in algebra, I think. It was interesting knowing the structure behind it.
