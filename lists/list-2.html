                        <p>This was a good lesson for introducing the groups, rings and fields concepts. Learning about Algebraic Structures was honestly confusing at first, but also really interesting. I expected algebra to just involve solving equations like before, but I quickly discovered that there's something called abstract algebra, and that changed how I saw the topic. </p>
                        <p>It was fascinating to realize that we weren't limited to just numbers. We explored how sets and operations can form structures like groups, each with their own rules. It felt like diving into the deeper foundations of math, like understanding the hidden rules behind a game.</p>
