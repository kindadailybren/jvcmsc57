                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p> Discrete Probability was definitely the most fun topic for me out of all the topics we covered. It was packed with problem-solving, which I personally enjoy a lot. What made it even more interesting were the real-life scenarios we got to analyze, like making decisions under uncertainty, calculating odds, and thinking in probabilities. As a Dota player, I could relate it to calculating odds of crits or winning probability. One memorable experience was when my friends and I played a gambling card game called "In-Between" during our trip to Samal — spoiler alert: I lost. But honestly, applying what we learned to that game made it even more entertaining and helped the concepts stick. Probability isn't just math, it's everywhere in life, games, and even risks we take.</p>

                                            Honestly I am confused which one is which since in the lessons you provided maam are only finite probabilty and probability theory, I am going to treat this as Probability Theory since this one was the first lesson of the topic list.
                                            The basics like sample spaces, events, and rules really felt like setting the stage for the drama of probability. It was satisfying to finally *understand* how randomness is structured.

                                            My absolute favorite. Bayes’ Theorem felt like mind-reading with math. I loved how it flips probabilities based on new info — like updating beliefs in real time. From medical testing to spam filtering, the applications blew my mind. This was peak Discrete Math for me.  masterpiece
